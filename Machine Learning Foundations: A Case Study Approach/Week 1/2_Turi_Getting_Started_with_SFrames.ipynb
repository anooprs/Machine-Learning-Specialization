entitled perception as a cognitive system his doctoral studies advisor was stephen toulmin alan gewirth robert richards and william wimsatt served on the doctoral committee michael strauss his ma thesis advisor and stephen toulmin have greatly influenced his philosophical views their thinking is marked by a unique combination of a broad outlook on the very profound issues of philosophy and life a careful analysis of the details and the ability to concretize their discussion in everyday issues despite such similarity they came from different backgrounds while strauss like his grandfather martin buber was submersed in the german tradition and his important writings are in german and hebrew toulmin a pupil of ludwig wittgenstein grew up within the english analytic traditionthe philosophers whose writings have made the greatest impact upon benzeev are aristotle baruch spinoza and immanuel kant kants main influence is most evident in ben zeevs discussions on epistemology and perception aristotles and spinozas impact is more apparent in his discussions of the mindbody problem and in his work on the emotionsbenzeevs major books are the perceptual system peter lang 1993 the subtlety of emotions mit up 2000 love online emotions on the internet cambridge up 2004 in the name of love romantic ideology and its victims with ruhama goussinsky oxford up 2008 die logik der gefhle

and head of the academic channel he established the interdisciplinary center for the study of emotions at the university of haifa he is currently the president of the newly established european philosophical society for the study of emotionsphilosophical viewexplanatory toolsthe choice of conceptual tools determines the nature of our explanations in light of the complexity of psychological phenomena the tools that we use to explain them should be flexible enough to accommodate the complexity of reality three such tools which are evident throughout benzeevs writings are the distinctions between various levels of description prototypical and binary categories and intrinsically and extrinsically valuable activities the distinction between various levels of description reflects his stratification approach concerning the bodymind problem this approach has three basic assumptions a the mind consists of dispositional and actualized states and not of internal isolated entities b physiological and mental states are not actually separate but belong to two different levels of descriptionthe relationship between them is one of stratification rather than of causality and c mental and physical states emerge along a continuum that ranges from simple to more complex states this approach is close to aristotle spinoza and the advocates of the emergent view of mental properties this issue is discussed in detail in his book on perception benzeev further believes that prototypical categories which have no clearcut boundaries and no equal degree of membership are generally more appropriate to the psychological realm and hence clearcut definitions of emotions are of little value and general characterizations should be given preference furthermore we should expect many grey areas when discussing human activities benzeev emphasizes the importance of intrinsically valuable activities for longterm happiness and profound love the combination of all three distinctions is significant in explaining psychological and in particular emotional phenomena despite his use of complex conceptual tools on many issues benzeev remains close to a critical yet commonsense viewperceptionin his various writings on perception in particular the perceptual system benzeev rejects the indirect view of perception and argues for the presence of direct nonpure perception he rejects nave realism as well as extreme subjectivism and argues for a critical realism such realism considers perceptual qualities as properties of the perceptual environment which is a relational environment that presupposes the existence of a perceiver within the perceptual environment perception is direct as it involves direct awareness of events in the environment but in light of the relational nature of this environment perceptual awareness merely provides partial information about the worldthat part which is influenced by the subjects characteristics in his view perception is direct in two major senses it is perception of the objects themselves not of internal mental representations and it is not preceded by mediating inferential processes benzeevs book the perceptual system received an excellent review in the review of metaphysics with the reviewer jack ornstein stating that benzeevs view is the only remotely plausible approach to the mindbody problem finally we have a theory of perception and the mind which any scientificallyminded critical philosopher can live with together with his work on perception benzeev has pursued related issues in the philosophy of psychology such as the bodymind problem and memory and has written on various philosophers in particular aristotle and thomas reidemotionsfive years after finishing his phd thesis benzeev began to study the emotions a topic that remains at the center of his research today in this field he was particularly influenced by aristotle mainly his analysis of emotions as evaluative attitudes and by spinoza in particular his emphasis on the importance of change in generating emotions the psychological work that has most influenced his thinking has been the cognitive structure of emotions 1988 by ortony clore and collins benzeev has published many articles in this field as well as several books the subtlety of emotions mit 2000 love online emotions on the internet cambridge 2004 in the name of love romantic ideology and its victims oxford 2008 written with ruhama goussinsky and die logik der gefhle kritik der emotionalen intelligenz suhrkamp 2009the subtlety of emotions his major work on emotions is divided into two major parts the first presents an overall conceptual framework for understanding emotions and the second discusses individual emotions he considers emotion to be a general mode of the mental system and suggests that the typical cause of emotions is a perceived change the typical emotional concern is a comparative concern and the typical emotional object is a human being typical emotions are considered to have certain basic characteristicsinstability great intensity a partial perspective and relative brevityand four basic componentscognition evaluation motivation and feeling emotions are regarded as having a significant practical and moral valueromantic loveromantic love has been the major emotion discussed by benzeev in his book love online he demonstrates the value of his conceptual framework for understanding emotions on the internet and in particular romantic relationships in cyberspace no new emotion has been created on the internet but the generation of emotions is often differentfor example in the speed at which such emotions are generated he argues that the chaotic and dynamic nature of cyberspace will not replace the more stable nature of actualspace as we cannot live in complete chaos the test of the internet will be whether it can complement ordinary romantic activities just as the telephone complements ordinary social activities or whether it will merely replace them with less valuable activities as the television frequently doesthe book in the name of love is about our ideals of love as expressed in the romantic ideology our experiences of love and the disparity between the two this ideology which assumes that love is comprehensive uncompromising and unconditional may lead to extreme behavior such as is found in men who murder their wives or partners allegedly out of love although romantic ideology may have a negative impact on many people in different circumstances it still has the positive function of a guiding ideal at the basis of ben zeevs proposed nurturing approach lies the assumption that in order for romantic love to be maintained the lover should not merely ensure that the beloved feels good it is imperative too that the lover is profoundly satisfied with the way in which the relationship enhances her own development and flourishing only a profoundly satisfied person can enhance the flourishing of the other and of their togetherness in many current societies love is on the mind of an evergreater number of people and its presence is a major criterion for relationships love can no longer be dismissed as a silly fantasy it is perceived as realistic and feasible for an increasing number of peoplein recent years benzeevs research has been focused on romantic compromises and related issues such as the profundity of love the relationship between love and sex and love and time in romantic compromises people relinquish a romantic value such as romantic freedom or intense sexual desire in exchange for a nonromantic value like the wish to live comfortably he considers such compromises to be the most common and painful syndrome in intimate relationships nevertheless he argues for the existence of good romantic compromises where there is a value convergence between the two lovers and the lovers minds are at rest as their togetherness has an intrinsic value',\n",

nor receive assistance with class work unless permitted by the instructor 22during the winter quarter of his freshman year at stanford plaintiff enrolled in computer science 106a as part of his course work he was required to complete programming assignments named yahtzee eudorette and afterdark toward the end of the quarter plaintiffs computer science instructor erik chen notified the stanford office of judicial affairs of approximately six cases involving sixteen students who had potentially violated the stanford honor code one of the cases involved plaintiff and a white student student a based on similarities in their yahtzee and eudorette assignments a second case involved plaintiff an asian student student b and an hispanic student based on similarities in their afterdark assignmentsnancy morrison was the judicial officer and assistant dean of students at stanford at the time of chens complaint as the judicial officer she was responsible for investigating instructor chens charges of honor code violations and deciding if formal charges should be made against a student according to morrison of the 16 students named by chen who is asian eight are asian and four of those have indian surnames six are caucasian one is hispanic and one is middle easternchen provided morrison with the results of a moss measure of software similarity analysis of the assignments moss is a system for determining copying in computer programming assignments the moss analysis showed a high degree of similarity between plaintiffs and student as yahtzee and eudorette submissions and a similarly high degree of similarity between plaintiffs and student bs afterdark submissions chen subsequently advised morrison that plaintiffs and the hispanic students afterdark submissions were not sufficiently similar to warrant honor code chargesmorrison met personally with plaintiff on march 23 2001 plaintiff stated that his assignments were available on stanfords computer network without password protection and that he was concerned that student a and student b may have accessed his work from the network without his knowledgemorrison met again with plaintiff on april 4 2001 at this meeting plaintiff initially stated that he wrote his code himself and that someone must have seen his code he later 33 stated in the meeting that he and student a had worked together on the yahtzee and eudorette assignments and that the code had been copied between plaintiff and student a he also advised that he had been stuck on the afterdark assignment and that student b had showed plaintiff the students code and plaintiff had copied the code from a hard copy of student bs codein an email two days later plaintiff again explained that he had become stuck on the afterdark assignment he approached student b and asked him how he had completed his function in order to help me he showed me a paper copy of his releasestream functionmorrison met with plaintiff and student a together on april 16 2001 during the meeting plaintiff repeatedly asked student a to admit that the two of them had worked together on the yahtzee and eudorette assignments student a repeatedly and consistently denied working with plaintiff student a presented morrison with an analysis that showed that the style in which he wrote code was consistent throughout all his assignments in the course whereas except for the yahtzee and eudorette assignments plaintiffs work did not include such styleon april 24 2001 morrison met with plaintiff and his parents plaintiff stated that he believed the honor code policy was unclear as to whether students could work together on codestudent b denied showing plaintiff any part of his afterdark assignment including the releasestream function his denial was corroborated by stanford computer security records that demonstrated that student b had not yet printed a copy of his assignment at the time plaintiff claimed student b showed him a hard copy student b also explained his thought process for approaching the assignment and identified similarities between plaintiffs and the students work product that went beyond the releasestream function that plaintiff had admitted reviewingas a result of her investigation morrison charged plaintiff with honor code violations for copying student a on the eudorette and yahtzee assignments and student b on the afterdark assignment she based her decision on plaintiffs changing and inconsistent 44 statements his admission that he collaborated on assignments the consistent and unequivocal denials of student a and student b the information she received from all parties the instructor and stanford computer security as well as the fact that plaintiff was implicated in multiple incidentsmorrison made the decision not to charge student a on april 17 2001 two months before charging plaintiff and one day after meeting together with plaintiff and student a she decided not to charge student b on august 1 2001 of

the deadline for plaintiffs opposition to give him even more time to conduct discovery to defeat defendants motion as the final deadline for plaintiffs opposition approached plaintiff moved for an

the governing law anderson v liberty lobby inc 477 us 242 24849 1986discussiona legal standardplaintiff contends that defendants charged him with cheating because of his national originrace the parties agree that the legal framework for evaluating plaintiffs claim is that established by mcdonnell douglas corp v green 411 us 792802 1973 this familiar test is usually applied in the employment context and requires a plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination by showing 1 he belongs to a protected class 2 he was qualified for the position 3 he suffered an adverse employment action and 4 some other circumstance indicates a discriminatory motive such as similarly situated individuals being treated more favorablysee godwin v hunt wesson inc 150 f3d 1217 1220 9th cir 1998 the test however should be adapted to the facts of each case see ruggles v cal polytechnic state univ 797 f2d 782 785 9th cir 1986to meet his prima facie burden plaintiff must show 1 he belongs to a protected class 2 he suffered some adverse action and 3 some other circumstance indicates a discriminatory motive such as similarly situated individuals being treated more favorably defendants argue that plaintiff must also show that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with cheating the court is not so certain as defendants and plaintiff acknowledge plaintiff cannot challenge the judicial panels finding that he copied student a and student b see defendants appendix of exhibits exh q plaintiffs opposition to defendants motion to dismiss stating that he does not challenge the judicial panels decision as the court has previously ruled such a contention is barred by res judicata as plaintiff filed and lost a state court lawsuit challenging the finding and his suspension the claim here is different he contends that both he and student a did what defendants claim constituted 77 cheating yet defendants charged him and not student a with cheating because of plaintiffs racenational origin accordingly for the purposes of the parties motions for summary judgment the court will not require plaintiff to prove the evidence was insufficient to charge him with cheatingwhen and if plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination the burden shifts to defendants to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse actionreeves v sanderson plumbing prods 530 us 133 142 2000 if defendants meet this burden of production then the burdenshifting framework disappears and the only remaining issue is discrimination vel non id at 143 although the burden of production shifts the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiffid internal quotation marks and citation omitted and in attempting to satisfy this burden the plaintiff once the defendant produces sufficient evidence to support a nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision must be afforded the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons but were a pretext for discrimination id citation omittedb nondecisionmakersas a preliminary matter summary judgment must be granted in favor of individual defendants beeson nyberg and weiss there is no evidence that any of these defendants were involved in the decision to charge plaintiff with cheating the sole issue is whether morrison and thus stanford intentionally discriminated against plaintiffc prima facie showingit is undisputed that plaintiff is a member of a protected class and that he suffered some adverse action namely being charged with and suspended for cheating the dispositive issue is whether he has submitted evidence sufficient to show that the reason he was charged was discriminatory that is because of his racenational origin the requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on summary 88 judgment is minimal and does not even rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence aragon v republic silver state disposal 292 f3d 654 659 9th cir 2002plaintiff has not satisfied even this minimal showing he first attempts to show discrimination by arguing that he and student a were similarly situated to raise an inference of discrimination the allegedly similarly situated person must be similarly situated in all material respects not in all respectsmcguinness v lincoln hall 263 f3d 49 53 2d cir 2001 the ultimate question that is informed by the similarly situated analysis is whether there is a basis for inferring discriminatory motive does the purported purpose of the challenged action require similar treatment of the two employees or does it justify different treatment due to differences in their status or situation rather than race or ethnicity bowden v potter 308 fsupp2d 1108 1117 nd cal 2004plaintiff and student a shared several similarities both were freshmen in the same computer science course with the same assignments and they lived next to each other in the stanford residence halls plaintiffs instructor initially prepared an analysis for the stanford office of judicial affairs that described six potential honor code violations involving 16 students next to plaintiffs and student as names as well as the names of three other students the instructor typed the word definite for the other names he typed potential or questionable chens analysis did not determine if the students had worked together or if one had copied the other without the others knowledge if morrison had decided to charge plaintiff and not student a based solely on this information plaintiff would have satisfied his prima facie burden because he and student a would have been similarly situated in all material respects see mcguinness 263 f3d at 53the decision to charge plaintiff however was not made at that time instead it was made after morrison conducted an investigation after that investigation plaintiff and student a were not similarly situated in material respectsfirst plaintiff unlike student a gave inconsistent explanations for the similarities between his work and student as work plaintiff initially told morrison that he had created his own code and that the other students must have copied his work he even explained that 99 his work was available on the stanford network without password protection he later contradicted his earlier statement by explaining that he and student a had worked together on two assignments and that with student bs permission he had reviewed a hard copy of some code on which student b had been working student a and student b in contrast each consistently denied working with plaintiff and never changed their storiessecond plaintiffs story was contradicted by documentary evidence stanford computer security records demonstrated that plaintiffs claim that he had reviewed a hard copy of a portion of student bs code was false student b further contradicted plaintiffs story by identifying other similarities between plaintiffs work and student bs work which are not explained by plaintiffs story student a also provided morrison with an analysis which showed that his work on the copied assignments was consistent with his style on all his other assignments in which there was no allegation of copying plaintiffs other work in contrast did not contain these unique characteristicsthird morrison was provided with stanford computer security records that indicate plaintiff had attempted to access the computer home folders of student a student b as well as other students in the computer science 106a classfourth plaintiff was implicated in three assignments involving two different students student a with two assignments student b with a different assignment whereas student a and student b were only implicated with plaintiff this evidence suggested that plaintiff was the person responsible for the copyingin short the evidence that plaintiff had cheated was much stronger than the evidence as to student a indeed the evidence suggested that plaintiff had copied student as work without his permission but there was no evidence that the converse had occurred that is that student a copied plaintiff without plaintiffs permission moreover morrison upon chens recommendation also eventually declined to charge student b with cheating the evidence with respect to this student was similar it suggested that plaintiff copied student b without his permission but not the converse in such circumstances no reasonable jury could find that student a was similarly situated to plaintiff see coward v cambridge school 1010committee 171 f3d 12 21 1st cir 1999 no valid comparison can be drawn between two incidents for the purpose of proving disparate treatment if differentiating or mitigating circumstances distinguish the students conduct or the schools responseplaintiff unsuccessfully attempts to dispute some of the above differences he claims that he did not make the statements morrison attests he made as evidence he cites paragraph 4 of his affidavit plaintiffs opposition at p 89 paragraph 4 merely states the white student student a and i worked together to complete assignments in cs 106a at the time we collaborated neither of us felt that such collaboration was in violation of any university policy including the honor code this testimony does not contradict morrisons affidavit indeed it is silent as to what plaintiff told morrison moreover plaintiffs testimony as to what student a felt is inadmissiblehe also contends that student a made similarly inconsistent statements his evidence that student a made such statements however consists solely of student as deposition testimony that he told morrison he had discussed the computer programming assignment with other students in the class plaintiffs motion for summary judgment at 15 such testimony does not contradict morrisons testimony that student a consistently denied collaborating with plaintiff even when plaintiff in front of morrison implored student a to admit to such collaboration in sum there is no admissible evidence that student a made inconsistent statements or statements similar to plaintiffsplaintiff also emphasizes that morrisons june 29 2001 letter charging him with honor code violations admits the possibility that student a and student b may have collaborated with plaintiff and thus violated the honor code themselves such statement however is not evidence that the evidence against student a and student b was as strong and compelling as the evidence against plaintiff that morrison had already finally decided not to charge student a and so notified him before june 29 also does not give rise to an inference of discrimination again the evidence against student a was slim at best compared to the evidence implicating plaintiff moreover morrison testified that the 1111 language used in the letter was standard and that in the letter she did not want to preclude any defense that plaintiff might raiseplaintiff makes no attempt to dispute the evidence that contradicts his story as to why he and student bs afterdark assignments were so similar for example he does not offer any evidence that disputes the evidence that stanford computer security records show that student b could not have printed out and provided plaintiff with a hard copy as plaintiff had explained nor does he respond to the point that his story about reviewing a hard copy of the students releasestream function does not explain the other similarities in their codeplaintiff also does not produce any evidence to dispute morrisons testimony that student a provided morrison with an analysis that showed that the specific stylistic characteristics for how student a wrote code were consistent for each of his assignments in the course and not consistent for plaintiffs assignments except for the two assignments the judicial panel found plaintiff had copied plaintiff contends that instructor chen did not perform such an analysis but that contention does not dispute morrisons testimony that student a showed her such an analysis indeed her testimony is corroborated by an email attached to plaintiffs motion plaintiffs exh p to motion for summary judgment again morrison was not faced with such damning evidence against student a instead student a consistently denied working with plaintiff and maintained that plaintiff must have copied him an allegation that was supported by the evidence presented to morrisonfinally plaintiff also does not dispute that morrison had evidence that plaintiff had attempted to open the computer files of student a student b as well as other students in his computer science classnext plaintiff contends that even if the decision to charge him was not discriminatory morrisons investigation itself was discriminatory he asserts that morrison sought out a statement from student as computer science teaching assistant but did not similarly seek such a statement for plaintiff until after he was formally charged as plaintiffs evidence demonstrates however student a provided morrison with the statement from his teaching assistant on his own there is no evidence that morrison asked for the statement there is 1212 also no evidence that morrison prevented plaintiff from providing her with such evidence should he have taken the initiative to do so moreover prior to plaintiffs hearing morrison did obtain a statement from plaintiffs teaching assistant notwithstanding the statement the judicial panel found that plaintiff had copied students a and bplaintiff also complains that morrison obtained student as final score for the class but not plaintiffs score which according to the record was a not passing grade again there is no evidence that morrison sought out student as final grade moreover there is no evidence she considered the grade in deciding not to charge him with cheatingplaintiffs other arguments are similarly meritless and do not require discussion his claim that discriminatory intent is evidenced by morrisons use of her nickname nanc on one of her emails to student a and on none of the emails to plaintiff is typical of these other argumentsc burden shifting and pretexteven assuming plaintiff had satisfied his minimal prima facie burden defendants have produced evidence that provides a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for charging plaintiff with cheating as is explained above see bodett v coxcom inc 366 f3d 736 744 9th cir 2004 in deciding whether a defendant has met its burden of production under mcdonnell douglas the court must take its evidence supporting its reason for the adverse action as trueas defendants have met their burden of production any presumption of evidence that arises from the prima facie showing disappears the question is on the record before the court could a reasonable jury find that plaintiffs racenational origin likely motivated defendants decision to charge plaintiff with cheating the answer is no there is no evidence that plaintiffs racenational origin played any role whatsoever rather plaintiff was charged because morrison believed the evidence supported a finding that plaintiff had copied student a and student b the judicial panel agreed in other words no reasonable jury could find that morrison did not honestly believe that plaintiff had copied student a and student b see bodett 366 f3d at 744 1313this conclusion is supported by the undisputed evidence that defendants did not charge student b who was asian with cheating and that of the six students in plaintiffs computer class she did charge with cheating two are caucasian moreover two of the students morrison decided not to charge are asian with indian surnamesplaintiff contends that at a meeting before morrison charged plaintiff morrison handed plaintiff a document prepared by an employee of student as fathers company and stated that plaintiff should take special note that the document was written by someone indian plaintiffs decl at 15 morrison denies that she made the statement but for summary judgment purposes the court must accept plaintiffs sworn testimony nonetheless this evidence does not save plaintiffs claim while the statement suggests that morrison was aware of plaintiffs ethnicity it does not suggest that she charged him with cheating because of his raceethnicity especially in light of the evidence discussed aboveplaintiffs contention that defendant beeson made a reference to his being indian is also unavailing again the statement is disputed but the court must accept plaintiffs sworn testimony as true the statement however was made more than eight months after morrison charged plaintiff with cheating and it was made by a person who was not involved in the decision to charge plaintiff the statement is thus insufficient to support a finding that plaintiffs raceethnicity was likely a motivating factor in morrisons decision to charge plaintiff 1414conclusionon the record before the court viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff no reasonable jury could find that defendants more likely than not charged plaintiff with cheating because of his racenational origin nor could they find that defendants treated him a certain way during their investigation because of his racenational origin accordingly defendants motion for summary judgment is granted and plaintiffs
